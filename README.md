Inspiration
StepSetGo is our primary Inspiration about why we choose this fitness application. It' s major principle is that it makes every step count. As easy as walking it helps users to stay motivated, engaged, push to move and reward you.

What it does 🤔
Fitness application to keep track of steps as we walk. You may also come across our fitness app various times in a day while using your smartphone and walkthrough in our daily Well Refined Fitness Blogs, health dietary videos, regular, Fitness & Healthy Lifestyle Blogs, A Guide For Every Fitness Enthusiast. We also have different workouts and scheduling an appointment with the trainer for prior guidance. The most interesting part is that we can use it in both Android,** iOS and **Web.

What's next for Fitnessify 🚀
In future we are planning to build this application with more tech features like "Providing Web3 Coins for achieving their health target" so they could use those coins to purchase something/ products in the application. This helps users to be motivated and focused on their health with much more care and conscious.
